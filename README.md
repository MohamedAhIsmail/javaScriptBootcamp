# JavaScript Bootcamp

Welcome to my **JavaScript Bootcamp** repository!  
This project documents my learning journey through an intensive JavaScript bootcamp, where I gained a strong foundation in modern JavaScript and applied my skills by building real-world projects.

## üöÄ What I Learned

Throughout this bootcamp, I explored a wide range of essential JavaScript concepts, including:

- ‚úÖ JavaScript Fundamentals (variables, data types, functions, loops, etc.)
- ‚úÖ DOM & BOM Manipulation
- ‚úÖ ES6+ Features (arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest, template literals, modules, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Working with APIs (`fetch`, `async/await`)
- ‚úÖ Regular Expressions (RegEx)
- ‚úÖ Local Storage & Session Storage
- ‚úÖ Form Validation
- ‚úÖ CRUD Operations

## üíº Projects Built

Here are some of the key projects I developed during the bootcamp:

- **To-Do List App**  
  A task management application using DOM manipulation and Local Storage.

- **E-commerce App**  
  A simple storefront UI with product listings and basic functionality.

- **CRUD System**  
  A standalone project demonstrating Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with dynamic UI updates and data persistence via Local Storage.

- **Login & Register System**  
  A secure front-end authentication flow using Local Storage to store user data, with form validation and feedback.

- **API Integration Examples**  
  Consuming and displaying data from external APIs using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3 (for layout and basic styling)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)
